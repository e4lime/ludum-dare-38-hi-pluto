Code getting messa af... 1.30 min left. Sound and music! Sooo tired :(:()







Optional:

pauses control 1 sek after unpause. NOPE

GUI add "Hello! :D/-<" when clicking on "prepare" . NOPE
One "special section" would be nice, like tons of astroids in a row . NOPE

make camera not go downwards? . NOPE

Juice it up. Planets squeezes when player hit checkpoints Maybe.. ShakeScale dotween, first sound


Misc:

Tween bugs when rotating the planet, probably cause parent is tweening. Maybe put a tweener container 
and acces it from rigid jump tween and planet rotation tween and use append?
- Im just rotating the planet with transform.Rotate for now, maybe do above later when i want to juice it
up with more tweens
