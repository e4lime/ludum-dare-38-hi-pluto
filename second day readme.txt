make camera not go downwards?








Tween bugs when rotating the planet, probably cause parent is tweening. Maybe put a tweener container 
and acces it from rigid jump tween and planet rotation tween and use append?
- Im just rotating the planet with transform.Rotate for now, maybe do above later when i want to juice it
up with more tweens
