Freeze player on start and respawn



Score system Points and height

SOUND AND MUSIC! AHHHHH


Optional:

One "special section" would be nice, like tons of astroids in a row

make camera not go downwards?

Juice it up. Planets squeezes when player hit checkpoints


Misc:

Tween bugs when rotating the planet, probably cause parent is tweening. Maybe put a tweener container 
and acces it from rigid jump tween and planet rotation tween and use append?
- Im just rotating the planet with transform.Rotate for now, maybe do above later when i want to juice it
up with more tweens
