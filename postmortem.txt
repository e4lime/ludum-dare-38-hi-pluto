The Good
Struggled with getting and got crazy anxiety. Took a walk and ideas started 
to pop up! Do physical work!

A completed game!


The Bad

3D. I need to learn Blender. Used alot of maya a few years ago but i have no idea what im doing in blender.

Do something in unity a week before the competition so you don't feel so rusty.

Stop making silly tools! They always get more complicated than u think. Just do it in the editor. 
Ure not sure u gonna use the result of the tools anyway

Stop checking inputed variables in editor. It only takes time and if it breaks just check the code. You 
are the designer and the coder remember.

Think of 4:3 resolutions, game broke on 4:3 displays

Stop with whatever you are doing 1h before deadline and tweak the game design instead! 
Maybe have a "design hour" ~6 hours before deadline so you dont have to panic 1h before deadline. Maybe 
a design hour when you wake up the second day so you dont have to panic ~6 hours before deadline...

Actually just have a deadline 6h before deadline and use the remaining 6h to juice it up.

Didn't have time to play with music

Use fonts, you are allowed to

The ugly
Too similar to winterbells 

Chaotic code mess the last few hours
