Mechanics
- World Earth autojumps on stars/astroids/comets etc (pick one)
- Control earth with mousemovement (try keys later if it feels bad)
- Gain 1 point for each JumpObject
- Planets are checkpoints 
- Respawn on checkpoint
- Screen scroll ups with planet, smooth




If time:
- Planets

	- Mercury 
	- Venus
- Keep falling until a planet saves you (instead of spawning at checkpoint)
- Fall down past sun and slung around to gain momentum at start (instead of going to mars directly)
- Something to avoid, like dangerous astroids
- Give planets personality
- music (Forgot to setup ableton with komplete, gonna take a while)
